To install the icnn-crown conda environment, run the following commands (for installation from the icnn-crown-from-history.yml file).
Pip installs need to be handled separately because some packages are not installable via conda or we want forked versions.
The last line is important so we can use the conda environment in a jupyter notebook.

conda env create -n icnn-crown --file icnn-crown-history.yml 
pip install git+https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/auto_LiRPA
pip install onnx
pip install vnnlib
pip install git+https://github.com/KaidiXu/onnx2pytorch
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=icnn-crown
